Excited to share my latest project: a fuel management system built with Python!

This system simulates a modern gas station operation, featuring:

• Secure employee authentication • Real-time fuel price updates • Accurate transaction processing with stock management • Detailed sales reporting with data visualization • User-friendly GUI using PySimpleGUI

The project demonstrates proficiency in:

Database management with SQLite
Secure password hashing
Multithreading for simultaneous operations
Data analysis and visualization with matplotlib
Error handling and user input validation
It's a great example of how Python can be used to create robust, real-world applications. Perfect for showcasing skills in software development, database management, and UI design.

Note this is just a playaround project nothing serious
To Run!!

>>install matplotlib, PySimpleGUI, tqdm and requests
#pip install  matplotlib PySimpleGUI tqdm requests11
>>then
#python fuel_system.py

ENJOY!!
